# PART I: WRITING AND INCLUDING HEADER FILES IN C++:
# ==================================================
# The demonstration directory containing this file contains
# a subdirectory called include, which is a conventional name
# for a directory containing header files.
#
# 1) USE EMACS TO CREATE A NEW HEADER FILE:
# =========================================

emacs include/HeadOfTheClass.h &

# Add an OPENING INCLUDE GUARD to the file. We will choose
# "HEADOFTHECLASS_H" as the name of our UNIQUE MACRO. Enter
# or copy the following lines

#ifndef HEADOFTHECLASS_H
#define HEADOFTHECLASS_H

# Now add a simple class definition to the header file.
# NOTE: If a header file contains a class defintion, it is
# conventional for the header file name to be the class name
# with a ".h" suffix appended.

# Examine the contents of the headerDemoClass file.

cat headerDemoClass

# Copy the class definition that the headerDemoClass
# file contains into include/HeadOfTheClass.h.
#
# Finally, add a CLOSING INCLUDE GUARD to our header file
# enter or copy the following line into include/HeadOfTheClass.h.

#endif

# SAVE include/HeadOfTheClass.h and exit emacs.

# 2) MODIFY AN EXISTING C++ PROGRAM TO INCLUDE THE HEADER:
# ========================================================
# The demonstration directory contains a file called
# "headerDemoMainComplete.cpp" that contains a main() function
# Some modifications are required to include HeadOfTheClass.h
#
# OPEN headerDemoMainComplete.cpp using emacs:

emacs headerDemoMain.cpp &

# Add the following include statement after the second comment:

#include "HeadOfTheClass.h"

# 3) BUILD THE PROGRAM:
# =====================
# To build the program the C preprocessor must be instructed to
# search the "include" directory to find HeadOfTheClass.h. To
# achieve this supply the -I flag to the invocation of clang++
# with the flag argument "include". The following invocation generates
# a binary executable called "headOfTheClass"

clang++ -std=c++11 -Iinclude -o headOfTheClass headerDemoMain.cpp

# 4) RUN THE PROGRAM:
# ===================
# This is accomplished in the familiar way.

./headOfTheClass


# PART II: CREATING SHARED LIBRARIES FROM C++ CODE:
# =================================================
#
# AS WELL AS providing a useful mechanism for REUSING SOURCE CODE, there
# are two other strong rationales for building shared libraries:
#
# 1) Upon compilation, inclusion of THE SAME SOURCE CODE into DIFFERENT
# PROGRAMS generally produces VERY SIMILAR BINARY CODE. If multiple
# standalone binaries incorporate essentially identical binary code, this
# is not efficient use of system STORAGE SPACE. Storage space can be saved
# by PRECOMPILING LOGICALLY DISTINCT and RESUSABLE subsets of source code
# and encapsulating the resulting BINARY CODE in a separate SHARED LIBRARY
# file that can be accessed by multiple standalone binaries.
#
# 2) If IMPROVEMENTS are made to the source code that is used to build a
# shared library, and that library is used by MULTIPLE STANDALONE BINARIES,
# then ONLY the shared library needs to be recompiled for ALL the
# standalone binaries that use it to benefit from the improved source code.
# If shared libraries were NOT used, then ALL the standalone binaries
# would need to be recompiled. 
#
# THIS DEMONSTRATION will use source code in SEPARATE HEADER and
# IMPLEMENTATION files to build a shared library. The HEADER file will
# ultimately be INCLUDED in other code by USERS of the library to provide
# DEFINITIONS of the programatic entities that the library provides. The
# IMPLEMENTATION file contains DEFINITIONS of the entities that are declared
# in the header file and is typically NOT distributed to library users.
#
# Examine the contents of the HEADER file, which is called "Library.h" and
# is stored in the "include" subdirectory. NOTICE that "Library.h" contains
# a DEFINITION of a class called "Library" (it is conventional for header
# files that define classes to share the name of the class they define), which
# ONLY provides method DECLARATIONS. DEFINITIONS are provided in the SEPARATE
# IMPLEMENTATION file.

emacs include/Library.h &

# Examine the contents of the IMPLEMENTATION file which is called
# "Library.cpp". The ".cpp" suffix is conventionally used for C++ IMPLEMENTATION
# files. "Library.cpp" provides the OUT-OF-CLASS DEFINITIONS for the methods
# that are declared in "Library.h". NOTICE that "Library.cpp" INCLUDES "Library.h".

emacs Library.cpp &

# To create a shared library from C++ source code, clang++ must be invoked
# using TWO EXTRA FLAGS, "-shared" and "-fPIC". This demonstration also uses
# a custom header file. Accordingly, the -I flag must also be provided to
# instruct the C preprocessor to search the "include" subdirectory for the
# required header file.
#
# The following invocation creates a shared library called "libLibrary.so"
# in the "lib" subdirectory using the source code provided in in "Library.cpp".
# NOTICE that the -o flag is still required in order to specify the output
# file name.

clang++ -std=c++11 -Iinclude -shared -fPIC -o lib/libLibrary.so Library.cpp

# PART III: LINKING WITH EXTERNAL LIBRARIES IN C++:
# =================================================
#
# To USE the "libLibrary.so" shared library that was created in the previous
# step, a STANDALONE BINARY must be built that LINKS against libLibrary.so.

# Examine the contents of VisitLibrary.cpp, which
# 1) Includes the "Library.h" header file.
# 2) Defines a main() function that INSTANTIATES a Library object and EXERCISES
# its functionality.

emacs VisitLibrary.cpp &

# The following invocation uses the source code provided in "VisitLibrary.cpp"
# to build a STANDALONE BINARY EXECUTABLE called "visitLibrary" that links
# against "libLibrary.so". NOTICE that the -I flag is provided since
# "VisitLibrary.cpp" INCLUDES "Library.h". The -L flag is also used to
# specify that the LINKER should search the "lib" subdirectory for shared
# libraries. Finally the ABBREVIATED name for "libLibrary.so" ("-lLibrary")
# is used to specify that "libLibrary.so" should be used as a "source file".
# The LINKER that is invoked by clang++ will AUTOMATICALLY recognize that
# this file should be linked against and NOT SIMPLY COMPILED into the binary
# executable.  

clang++ -std=c++11 -Iinclude -o visitLibrary -Llib -lLibrary VisitLibrary.cpp

# Finally, invoke the standalone binary executable.

./visitLibrary
